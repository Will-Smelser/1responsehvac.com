          <p>
          	Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems have been shown to act as a collection source for a variety of 
          	contaminants that have the potential to affect health, such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. 
          	The cleaning of such contaminants from the Vent System and home should be considered as one component in an overall 
          	plan to improve indoor air quality.
          </p>
          
          <h2 id="HowOften">How often should vents be cleaned</h2>
          <p>
          	Frequency of cleaning depends on several factors, not the least of which is the preference of the home owner. 
          	Some of the things that may lead a home owner to consider more frequent vent cleaning include:
          	<ul>
			<li>Smokers in the household.</li>
			<li>Pets that shed high amounts of hair and dander.</li>
			<li>Water contamination or damage to the home or HVAC system.</li>
			<li>Residents with allergies or asthma who might benefit from a reduction in the amount of indoor air pollutants in the home's HVAC system.</li>
			<li>After home renovations or remodeling.</li>
			<li>Prior to occupancy of a new home.</li>
			</ul>

          <h2 id="HowTo">How to clean vents</h2>
          <p>
          	The most effective way to clean vents and duct systems is to employ Source Removal methods of cleaning. 
          	This requires a contractor to place the system under negative pressure, through the use of a specialized, 
          	powerful vacuum. 
          	While the vacuum draws air through the vents, devices are inserted into the vents to dislodge any debris 
          	that might be stuck to interior surfaces. The debris can then travel down the vents to the vacuum, 
          	which removes it from the system and the home.  Your vents should be visibly clean on the interior walls
          	when the cleaning is complete.
