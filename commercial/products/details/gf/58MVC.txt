<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, 'Sans serif'; font-size: x-small;">The 58MVC Multipoise Variable-Capacity Condensing Gas Furnace is features the IdealComfortHeat&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; System, which makes this one of the quietest furnaces in the industry. The innovative Vari-Phase&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; gas valve is at the heart of this quiet operation, along with the variable-speed ECM 3.0 blower motor and variable-speed inducer motor. The Infintity ICS also provides 3.5 times tighter temperature control than single stage furnaces. With an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) of up to 95% in upflow only, the Infinity ICS provides exceptional savings as well. The Infinity ICS Gas Furnace also features 4-way multipoise installation flexibility, and available in 5 model sizes. The 58MVC can be vented as a direct vent/2pipe furnace or as an optional ventilated combustion air application. A Carrier Infinity&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; Control and Infinity or Performance Air Conditioner or Heat Pump, can be used to form a complete Infinity System. All units meet California Air Quality Management District emission requirements. All sizes are design certified in Canada.</span></p>
