		 <ul style="margin-left:20px;display:block;">
		 	<li>Clothes dryer fires account for about 15,600 structure fires, 15 deaths, and 400 injuries annually.</li>
		 	<li>Eighty percent of clothes dryer fires in structures occur in residential buildings.</li>
		 	<li>Annually, 12,700 clothes dryer fires occur in residential buildings resulting in 15 deaths and 300 injuries.</li>
		 	<li>"Failure to clean" is the leading factor contributing to clothes dryer fires in residential buildings.</li>
		 	<li>New home construction trends place clothes dryers and washing machines in more hazardous locations 
away from outside walls such as bedrooms, second-floor hallways, bathrooms, and kitchens.</li>

		<h2 style="padding-left:10px;">Lint Alert Plugin and Exhaust Sensor</h2>
		<img width="200" style="padding:10px" align="left" src="/images/lint_fire/lint-alert-plugin.jpg" />
		<p style="padding-left:10px;">
		When lint builds up over time-or some type of debris, nest or malfunction occurs in the dryer exhaust system-all blockage indicator lights will illuminate as shown in this close-up.
		</p>
		<p>
		The alarm state is also accompanied by an audible alert that can be muted until the exhaust system can be cleaned or repaired.  When the exhaust is running efficiently, the first LED is lighted. Under normal operation, lint naturally builds up in the system. As this happens, more indicators will progressively illuminate to keep you up to date on system efficiency so you can have the dryer maintained before energy is wasted or there's a fire danger.  A clean dryer duct can also extend the life of your appliance.
